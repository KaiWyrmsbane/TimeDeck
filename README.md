# Lawnmower Website

## I'm building a website were people can shop for lawnmowers. Users will be able filter their searches using: brand, year, motor size, deck size, mower type, price, and mower status, The site will also compare prices with other businesses nearby. The website will also have an about, and contact page for people who wish to contact the website owner.

This website will use HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and java-script to build a lawnmower dealership website, making is easier for people to find lawn mowers for a great price.
