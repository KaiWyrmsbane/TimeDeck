# James Time Management Web App (TimeDeck)

## An example of a simple yet informative way for employees to keep track of their hours worked, PTO time left, and personal settings on account.

This project shows one of the ways a time management system could work. How to build the logic behind that system
using the C#, ASP.NET, and EF Core. In this system an employee will be able to:

* Create an account then sign in with that account
* Clock-in and out and receive the number of hours worked when clocked-out. On the same 
page the user will be able to see the number of PTO hours they have and the renewal date of their PTO.
* Decide to take time off on specific days whether it be Vacation, Sick, or emergency time while seeing PTO renewal date.
* Edit account settings such as name, email, password, etc.
